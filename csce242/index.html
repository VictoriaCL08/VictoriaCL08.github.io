                                    <p>This assignment introduced basic elements for an html webpage. This included creating a title, header,
                                        and body section. Tables, images, bulleted lists, and links were incorporated into the html webpage.

                                    <p>In this Assignment, we used css to style an html webpage. Styles included adding aesthetics to a navigation bar,
                                        creating uniform font and text color, and having sections with various background colors.

                                    <p>In this assignment, we used flexbox and media query to design a page layout containing different
                                        sections, articles, and asides. The page had a horizontal layout in larger resolutions and a vertical
                                        layout in smaller resoltions. </p>
