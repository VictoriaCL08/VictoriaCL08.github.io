        <h1>Electric vehicles are the future of transportation</h1>
        <p>Electric cars have been growing in popularity over the past decade, and for good reason.
            Electric cars are significantly more efficient than traditional gas cars
            in terms of CO<sub>2</sub> emmisions, even when taking into account the emmisions required to make
            the car. Furthermore, electric vehicles can be charged using energy produced from renewable 
            energy such as solar or wind. This means that an electric car can be powered by the sun.
        </p>
        <p> Because of the rise in popularity of electric cars, many car companies have developed 
            electric car models. As a result, the cost of electric cars has decreased significantly. 
            What makes EVs expensive is the cost of the battery packs used and the slow charging time.
            Battery technology is rapidly improving to meet the demand, and each year electric cars are
            getting better and better. 
        </p>
        <h2>Why electric vehicles are great:</h2>
            <o1>
                <li>Less CO<sub>2</sub> emissions</li>
                <li>Can be combined with renewable energy for carbon neutral transportation</li>
                <li>Overall more efficient</li>
                <li>Quieter</li>
            </o1>
