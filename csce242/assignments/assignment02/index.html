                <h2> Why Cross Country is a Great Sport</h2>
                <p>This is a paragraph about why cross country is fun.
                    Running is a great form of exercise. It is really good
                    for your cardiovascular system and running also boosts your
                    mood and reduces stress (I think). Running with other people
                    is even better because you can talk to your friends while exercising.
                </p>
                <p>Here is a second paragraph about why running is great. As a sport,
                    running is good because it is very cheap and there are less injuries than
                    other sports. All you need to run are a good pair of running shoes. There
                    is no special equipment required. Running is not a contact sport so there are
                    significantly less injuries than in sports like soccer or football.
